Make sure to follow the guidelines below and do not skip any of them:
1. Ensure your code can successfully execute. If needed, you can also write tests to verify your code.
2. Maintain proper spacing and arrangements of elements in the slide: make sure to keep sufficient spacing between different elements; do not make elements overlap or overflow to the slide page.
3. Carefully select the colors of text, shapes, and backgrounds, to ensure all contents are readable.
4. The slides should not look empty or incomplete. When filling the content in the slides, maintain good design and layout.

Your responsibilities include:
1. **Visual Difference Identification**: Identify differences between the target slide and the current slide.
2. **Code Localization**: Pinpoint locations in the code that could be modified to reduce or eliminate these differences. This may require counterfactual reasoning and inference from the visual discrepancies."""

If the current slide is very close to the target slide, only output an "OK!" and do not output other characters."""
